Bright TV aims to better understand audience viewing behaviour and customer demographics to improve programming decisions, audience engagement, and strategic planning.

This project analyses television viewing records alongside subscriber demographic information using Databricks SQL. The project follows a complete analytics lifecycle, including data exploration, quality assessment, cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, KPI development, and business recommendations.

The final deliverables include SQL scripts, business insights, interactive dashboard designs, and executive recommendations that demonstrate how data can support informed business decisions.

# 🎯 Business Problem

Bright TV collects large volumes of customer profile and television viewership data. However, raw operational data alone does not provide meaningful insights for executives.

The challenge is to transform this data into actionable intelligence that answers critical business questions, including:

- Who are Bright TV's primary viewers?
- Which television channels attract the largest audiences?
- When do viewers watch television the most?
- Which provinces have the highest engagement?
- Which customer segments should receive targeted marketing campaigns?
- How can Bright TV improve customer retention and viewer engagement?

This project addresses these questions through SQL analysis and business intelligence techniques.

This workflow demonstrates a complete data analytics lifecycle, transforming raw data into actionable business insights.

# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before performing any analysis, the datasets were assessed to ensure data quality, consistency and reliability.

The following data quality checks were completed using Databricks SQL.

### ✔ Duplicate Detection

Verified that each subscriber (UserID) appeared only once in the customer profile dataset.

### ✔ Missing Values

Checked for missing values across critical fields including:

- UserID
- Age
- Gender
- Race
- Province
- Email
- Social Media Handle

### ✔ Standardisation

Several inconsistent values were standardised.

Examples include:

| Original Value | Standardised Value |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Sawsee | SawSee |
| Supersport Live Events | Live Events |
| other | None |
| blank values | Uncategorized |

### ✔ Data Validation

Validated:

- Minimum and maximum ages
- Null User IDs
- Duplicate subscribers
- Invalid province values
- Blank gender values

These quality checks ensured that the analytical dataset accurately represented Bright TV's subscriber base before business analysis commenced.

# ⚙ Feature Engineering

Several analytical features were created from the original datasets to improve reporting and dashboard development.

New variables include:

| Feature | Business Purpose |
|----------|------------------|
| Age Groups | Audience segmentation |
| Region | Province standardisation |
| Time of Day | Peak viewing analysis |
| Day Classification | Weekend vs Weekday comparison |
| Screen Time Bucket | Viewer engagement analysis |
| Month ID | Monthly trend reporting |
| Watch Date | Daily analysis |
| TV Channel | Channel standardisation |

These engineered features transformed raw operational data into meaningful business metrics for analysis.

- HOUR()
- CAST()
- Derived columns
- Time categorisation
- Age segmentation

### Data Analysis
